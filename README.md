### Hi there 👋

I'm Thiago Santos, an Android Developer since 2011 that likes to find patterns that should be improved and creating happyness to my workteam.

- 🇧🇷 I'm a **Brazilian** guy living on **Aracaju/Sergipe**;
- 👨‍💻 Working remote;
- 👨‍🎨 Daily trying improve projects architecture and build time;
- 💘 In love with new technologies as Jetpack Compose but UI is my weakness too! Trying solve this issue in my free time;
- 👷‍♂ Kotlin is now my primary language. Studying Rust in my free time to have a low level knowledge without touch C/C++;
- 🚧 My english need to be improved too because my communication skills are not so good;
- 🎮🐶 Classic games and my dog are my free time tasks too.
